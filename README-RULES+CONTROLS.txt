Important Information:

KNOWN ISSUE: When using enlarge power up, after lossing it the player is able to clip half its body though the wall. Was not able to fine what caused this, will continue to look for solution after submiting
EDIT: Issue still not fixed but seems to do with when a static mesh component is scaled non-uniformly in tick, still investigating in my own time.
